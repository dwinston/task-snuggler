  - monthly strategic meetings 
  - use github issue tracker
  - transition to meeting every two weeks?
    Keep it every week for November. Reevaluate then.
* OPEN confirm removal action on "click #removeCommitment"

   - I thought it would just cancel my edits to the commitment. Other
     users could be similarly confused.
   - add prompt() dialog to confirm removal. Not annoying because I
     don't think batch removal will be common.
