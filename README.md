What is Task Snuggler?
======================

We make commitments. Commitments can help you improve a certain skill
through practice. It can also help you to live a healthier
lifestyle. Usually, it is desirable to consolidate a commitment by
deciding on the number of sessions and the hours per session. A good
example would be jogging twice a week, with each session lasting one
hour. Unfortunately, given a tightly packed schedndule, it’s difficult
and painful to schedule and re-schedule these sessions, week after
week.

Task Snuggler wants to help you stick to commitments. This is because
[the cognitive load from decisions about
scheduling](http://seriouspony.com/blog/2013/7/24/your-app-makes-me-fat)
can hurt the willpower you need to turn your commitments into real
habits. Therefore, Task Snuggler is built to auto-schedule personal,
habitual commitments, so they fit along with your busy schedules.

Snuggle your tasks!

How does it work?
=================

* You specify a commitment with sessions/week and hours/session (both
can change; that’s fine).  Sessions get added to your calendar so as
not to conflict with existing events.

* If you add events, your commitment sessions will adjust as
necessary.

* If you miss a session, your calendar will adjust if possible so you
can do all your sessiosn before the week ends.

* If you manually drag and drop commitment sessions, Task Snuggler
listens and learns your preferences so that it learns where to place
your commitment sessions based on your preference and free time.

* For one-off events, they can be inserted manually or imported by
using a Google account.
